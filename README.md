# HS-Calculus-1_Funciton-Analysis (2015)

Calculus 1 Project - Function Analyzer 

  Equation.Java analyzes polynomial functions of any degree, with a given domain, and computes the first and second deriviate of the polynomial
as well as its critical values, inflection points, concavity, extrema and domain. 

Tester.Java prompts the user for input and calls the functions defined in Equation.java to analyze the given polynomial.
